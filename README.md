html-canvas game  (pixel art!)


When I started the original game (http://www.j-ohlsen.com/www/game), I didn't really know what I was doing and was learning as I made progress. 
I finally got to understand Object Oriented programming well enough and was making rapid progress, but a few (major) bugs, from the earlier days, kept pulling me back. 

The best solution was to start over, planning things right from the start, armed with this newfound knowledge. 

So far the major questions have been answered, but are yet to be fully implemented.
