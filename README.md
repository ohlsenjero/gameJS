# gameJS
html-canvas game  (pixel art!)

A long journey to teach myself how to make video games. Inspired on those classic 8-bits'.
This is a preview of the engine, with pretty much all of the basics covered.. enemies to be thrown in there as it slowly unfolds into an actual game.

[Arrow Keys : move around  -  when paused: select weapon or items to use]  
[2          : fire weapon]  
[1          : use items]  
[shift      : swap between items]  
[space      : pause - menu]  
[alt        : when paused: select teleport-item (only on the right place)]    


Can you get to the teleportation pad? There's two different items you can get to find your way. One will open the big door, whereas the other one will instead allow you to go over deep-water without drowning... (careful with the quicksand too!).
