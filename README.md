html-canvas game  (pixel art!)


When I started the original game (http://www.j-ohlsen.com/www/game), I didn't really know what I was doing and was learning as I made progress. 
I finally got to understand Object Oriented programming well enough and was making rapid progress, but a few (major) bugs, from the earlier days, kept pulling me back. These had to do with the previous mess I had build upon and they were becoming extremely hard to come around (and to re-do certain parts of the code was tricky, now that it had grown to such an extent). 

The best solution was to start over, planning things right from the start, armed with this newfound knowledge. 

And it worked! In one week I got to what had taken me for ever.However, University time was back and had to be put on hold. So far, eveything "works" and is set up to work with things that haven't been added fully (like other rooms, doors and such). Next step is to, now that it really works, proceed to draw the right images so it also looks right.
