html-canvas game  (pixel art!)


The original game (http://www.j-ohlsen.com/www/game) was a learning experience.
Eventually I got to understand Object Oriented programming well enough, but a few bugs, from the earlier days, kept pulling me back. 

The best solution was to start over, planning things right from the start, armed with this newfound knowledge. 

So far the major questions have been answered, but are yet to be fully implemented.
