-- there was this bug with the doors, opening a 6Door right after a single door would crash the game
						but putting the closeDoor-timer from 30 to 40... (giving it a bit more time) prevents it....
																									FUCK
										Now if running, it can still happen on 40... weird thing is it won't happen on 30 anymore.... what the fuck.. (50 seems safe anyway)

										so theres something aobut 30 that is just the right speed to fuck things up

										ALSO CAN"T GRAB 290 ITEM as long as there is a door about to close....





______________


--- 270 DOORS have to be 3 seconds AWAY from stairs!!!!
  -- it doesnt even always happen.. its like "go stairs and back, then break a wall AND THEN 
  																	hurry to the stairs again...---> crash!"
  					\
  			Exactly  10 tiles away (or maybe 8.. still heaps)!! (on normal speed... )
  						then again considering BIG landscapes.. shouldnt be a problem
Solution:: (if seen to happen again or if really want one around a door... or if too much speed)  
SEPARATE THE FUCKING BREAKABLE DOORS >>> breakDoorOpen(bla, bla, bla)....... fuck
												breakDoorOpening[q].id, tindex.... breakDoorOpening =[];



... (earlier notes)


breakable doorsReClose tendrian que funcionar distinto. 
    	No abrirse en bloque (como las demas puertas), pero individualmente 
    									
    						 // por ahora se pueden usar solos los breakable (y limitando severamente su numero)
    						 				>> aunque puede ser el unico modo

    						 						se podria dejar asi para estos dos, 
    						 						y los obstacles que se vuelven a cerrar, para que tengan el mismo ID podrian entonces ser "enemies" que actuan como bloques
    						 						or maybe check their IDs against their index in the map[]
    /

    eso que hice en inActive[ID] vs .Tindex >>> hacer con  DoorOpening >> cosa que distinga y abra solo ese tile
    																			a las 250<>275

  .. y yo digo, breakable door tendrian qu irse a la mierda (refundarse... y hacerse bien desde 0, con todo lo demas)

NOW THAT i SEPARATED TILEDEFINE FROM WHAT pixel X to point at in Sprite
							\
		can do unique drawings for each edge, easy...!!! (same as now basically but diff tile/edge per number)
														just more numbers, but look at secret of mana or...
														....no rounded edge in any of those games
									[and they look amazing, but heaps of diff tile numbers then: plan out right]

	also, smaller tiles means less use of double floor wall-switch (transition area)		
	
			in this sense, edges could be left on as a pre-game hack, so it looks decent quickly, 
				but then when final map decided upon >> take off and doo all of those edges manually/individually
																						(with their own tile number)
