html-canvas game  (pixel art!)

A long journey to teach myself how to make video games. Inspired on those classic 8-bits'.
This is a preview of the engine, with pretty much all of the basics covered.. enemies to be thrown in there as it slowly unfolds into an actual game.

[Arrow Keys : move around  -  when paused: select weapon or items to use]
[2          : fire weapon]
[1          : use items]
[shift      : swamp between items]
[space      : pause - menu]
[alt        : when paused: select teleport-item (it will only work when standing on teleportPad)]


Can you find the key to the other side? Follow the safe path around the quicksand..
